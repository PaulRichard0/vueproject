    <p>A secure place to nap during long layovers and cancels flights. I've been stuck in airports for 6 hours or more. I would have paid $20 an hour to be able to sit in a small quiet private room with a very comfy reclining chair and an alarm that woke me if there was a status change in my flight or if my flight was boarding. Bonus if it has a small desk and chair so I can work and take business calls in private.
A place to take a shower. After a long flight, a shower will make you feel like a new person, especially if you have to board another long connections flight.
A gym. Being stuck in an airline seat for hours makes you stiff and sore. If I have a long layover, a small place with a treadmill, space to stretch, and some weights would be ideal. I don't need an Olympic weight room, just enough to get the blood flowing again.</p>
